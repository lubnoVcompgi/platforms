Electrotherapy is the use of electrical currents to treat various medical conditions, such as pain, muscle weakness, inflammation, wound healing, and nerve stimulation. Electrotherapy has a long history of development and application, dating back to the ancient times when people used electric fish to shock their patients. Today, electrotherapy is a widely used modality in physiotherapy, rehabilitation, sports medicine, and other fields.

One of the most popular and authoritative books on electrotherapy is Clayton's Electrotherapy: Theory and Practice, which was first published in 1932 by Edward Bellis Clayton, a British physiotherapist and lecturer. The book covers the principles, techniques, indications, contraindications, and precautions of various forms of electrotherapy, such as direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), high-frequency currents (HFC), low-frequency currents (LFC), interferential currents (IFC), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), iontophoresis, ultrasound, shortwave diathermy (SWD), microwave diathermy (MWD), and laser therapy.
 
The book has been revised and updated several times over the years, with the latest edition being the 9th edition published in 2017. The 9th edition features new chapters on electroacupuncture, biofeedback, and electrical safety. It also includes updated information on evidence-based practice, clinical guidelines, and recent research findings. The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous illustrations, tables, and case studies. It is suitable for students, practitioners, and educators in the field of electrotherapy.
 
However, the book is not widely available in digital format. The only PDF version that can be found online is a scanned copy of the 9th edition that has been uploaded by some users on Scribd[^1^] [^2^], a platform for sharing documents and books. The PDF file has a size of about 14 MB and a length of 128 pages. The quality of the scan is not very high, and some pages are blurry or distorted. Moreover, the PDF file is not searchable or editable.
