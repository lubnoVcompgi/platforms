If you are looking for a software that can help you create 2D reinforcement sheets from 3D models in Revit, you might want to check out SOFiSTiK Reinforcement Detailing 2016. This software is a package that includes two solutions: Reinforcement Detailing and Reinforcement Generation. These solutions cover all your needs for effective reinforcement processes in the BIM method.
 
Reinforcement Detailing is a solution that significantly accelerates the creation of 2D reinforcement plans from the 3D reinforcement of a Revit model. It consists of software and a set of families that can easily be modified to meet national or company standards. It also allows you to create bar lists, bending schedules and cut lists for wire meshes. You can use various tools and workflows to annotate, detail and document your reinforcement model.

Reinforcement Generation is a solution that allows you to conveniently generate a 3D reinforcement model from design results in Autodesk Revit. You can use it to distribute reinforcement in elements with complex shapes, such as slabs, walls or columns. You can also use it to create rebar and fabric shape details, copy reinforcement with all annotations, details, dimensions and related views, and export your model to other formats.
 
With SOFiSTiK Reinforcement Detailing 2016, you can benefit from the following features:
 
- Safe: You can safely create country-specific plans using the included "Content Packs". Your reinforcement only needs to be checked once.
- Fast: Using a 3D model, you can quickly and easily perform a variety of plan derivations according to your requirements.
- Open: Thanks to the openness of the programs, plans can be "reinforced" directly from Revit with SOFiCAD for a particularly fast process.
