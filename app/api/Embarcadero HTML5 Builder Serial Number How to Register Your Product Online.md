## How to Get Started with HTML5 Builder
 
If you are ready to create your own web and mobile applications with HTML5 Builder, you can download a free trial version from the [Embarcadero website](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/html5-builder/free-download). The trial version is fully functional for 30 days and allows you to explore all the features and components of HTML5 Builder. You can also access the [documentation](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/HTML5_Builder/en/Main_Page) and the [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwUPJvR9mZHjZnQWf0KzgQoWSPQHnA4-8) to learn how to use HTML5 Builder effectively.
 
Once you have installed HTML5 Builder, you can create a new project from the File menu or the Start Page. You can choose from different project types, such as Web Application, Mobile Application, Web Service or PHP Application. You can also select a template or a sample to start with. Then you can design your user interface by adding components from the Tool Palette to the Designer. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the components using the Object Inspector and the Events tab. You can also write your code in PHP or JavaScript using the Code Editor. You can switch between the Designer and the Code Editor using the tabs at the bottom of the IDE.
 
When you are ready to test your application, you can use the Run button or press F9 to launch it in your default browser. You can also use the Device Emulator or the Live Preview feature to test your application on different browsers and devices. You can debug your code using breakpoints, watches, call stack and local variables. You can also use the Console tab to view messages and errors.
 
When you are satisfied with your application, you can deploy it to your web server or package it as a native app for your target platform. You can use the Deploy button or press F12 to open the Deployment Manager. There you can configure your deployment options, such as destination folder, files to include or exclude, database connection parameters and more. You can also use PhoneGap Build to create native packages for iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone. You will need a PhoneGap account and a certificate for each platform.
