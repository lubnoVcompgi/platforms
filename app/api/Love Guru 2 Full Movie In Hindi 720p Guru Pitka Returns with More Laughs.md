Love Guru 2 is a sequel to the 2007 comedy film Love Guru, starring Mike Myers as Guru Pitka, a self-help guru who tries to help celebrities with their love problems. The film was a box office flop and received mostly negative reviews from critics and audiences alike. However, it seems that the makers of Love Guru 2 did not learn from their mistakes and decided to make another movie with the same formula.

Love Guru 2 follows Guru Pitka as he travels to India to find his long-lost love, who is now married to a Bollywood star. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and challenges, such as a rival guru, a monkey sidekick, and a mysterious assassin. He also tries to help a young couple who are in love but face opposition from their families.
 
The film is supposed to be a parody of Bollywood movies and Indian culture, but it ends up being a mockery and an insult. The jokes are crude, offensive, and unfunny. The characters are stereotypes and caricatures. The plot is nonsensical and predictable. The acting is hammy and over-the-top. The music is annoying and repetitive. The special effects are cheap and unrealistic.
 
Love Guru 2 is a waste of time and money. It is not worth watching even if you are a fan of Mike Myers or Bollywood movies. It is one of the worst comedy films ever made. It is an example of how not to make a sequel or a spoof. It is a film that should be avoided at all costs.
  
Love Guru 2 is not only a bad movie, but also a harmful one. It promotes stereotypes and prejudices about India and its people. It shows India as a backward and exotic country, full of poverty, corruption, violence, and superstition. It portrays Indians as ignorant, naive, gullible, and irrational. It makes fun of their accents, customs, beliefs, and traditions. It exploits their culture for cheap laughs and mockery.
 
Love Guru 2 also fails to respect the original source of its inspiration: Bollywood movies. Bollywood movies are a diverse and vibrant genre of cinema that have a huge fan base around the world. They are known for their colorful costumes, catchy songs, elaborate dances, and romantic stories. They are not meant to be realistic or logical, but rather entertaining and emotional. They are a form of escapism and fantasy for millions of people.
 
Love Guru 2 does not understand or appreciate the essence of Bollywood movies. It tries to imitate them without any creativity or originality. It copies their scenes and dialogues without any context or meaning. It spoofs their songs and dances without any rhythm or grace. It mocks their stories and characters without any depth or empathy. It reduces Bollywood movies to a series of clichÃ©s and jokes.
  
Love Guru 2 is not a movie that anyone should watch or support. It is a movie that insults and hurts the sentiments of millions of people who love and respect India and its culture. It is a movie that spreads misinformation and negativity about a country that has a rich and diverse history and heritage. It is a movie that does not deserve any attention or appreciation.
