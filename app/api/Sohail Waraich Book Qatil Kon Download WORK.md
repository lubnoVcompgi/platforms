Here is a possible rewrite of the text with more detail:
  
Sohail Warraich is a well-known Pakistani journalist and author of two books: Ghaddar Kaun? and Qatil Kaun?. In his first book, Ghaddar Kaun (Who's the Traitor?), he explores the facts and circumstances that led to the military coup d'Ã©tat of 1999 in Pakistan that ousted the elected government of Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif. He also reveals the aftermath of the events on October 12, 1999, when Sharif was arrested and charged with treason. Warraich conducted an exclusive interview with Sharif, in which the former Prime Minister disclosed many new facts about his personal and political life. Warraich included these revelations in his book, which he completed after almost three years of research and writing. This book covers the entire life story of Mian Nawaz Sharif, who served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan three times and was disqualified from office by the Supreme Court in 2017. In September 2020, Warraich published his second book titled Yeh Company Nahin Chale Gi (this company won't run), which was a critical analysis of the current political situation in Pakistan. However, his book was soon removed from the bookstores in Pakistan due to objections on and reservations about a cartoon on its cover that depicted the power dynamics between the military and civilian leadership. According to Samaa TV News website, "The cartoon on the cover showed General Bajwa sitting in a chair and PM Khan sitting in his feet. The leaders of the opposition Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Maryam Nawaz were shown trying to look into the room from a window."[3][6]

Warraich's books have generated a lot of interest and controversy in Pakistan and abroad. His first book, Ghaddar Kaun, was praised by some as a courageous and honest account of the political turmoil in Pakistan, while others criticized it as a biased and sensationalized version of events. Some also questioned the authenticity and credibility of Sharif's interview, claiming that he had changed his stance on many issues over time. Warraich defended his book as a factual and objective report based on his extensive interviews and investigations.
  
His second book, Yeh Company Nahin Chale Gi, was also met with mixed reactions. Some appreciated his bold and critical analysis of the current government and its relationship with the military establishment, while others accused him of being anti-state and pro-opposition. The cartoon on the cover of the book sparked a lot of controversy and anger among the supporters of the ruling party and the army. They demanded that the book be banned and the author be punished for disrespecting the national institutions. Warraich claimed that he had no intention of hurting anyone's sentiments and that the cartoon was meant to be a satire.
