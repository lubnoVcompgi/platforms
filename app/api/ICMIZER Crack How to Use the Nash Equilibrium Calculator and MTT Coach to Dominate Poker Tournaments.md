## How to Use ICMIZER to Find the Best Push/Fold Ranges
 
One of the most important skills in tournament poker is knowing when to push or fold your hand. Pushing means going all-in with your entire stack, while folding means giving up your hand and waiting for a better opportunity. Pushing or folding is often the optimal decision when you have a short stack (less than 15 big blinds) or when you are in late position (such as the button or the small blind).
 
ICMIZER can help you find the best push/fold ranges for any situation. You can input the relevant parameters, such as your stack size, your position, the blinds, the antes, the number of players, and the payout structure. ICMIZER will then calculate the optimal range of hands that you should push or fold with, based on the ICM.
 
For example, let's say you are in a 9-handed tournament with a $10 buy-in and a $100 prize pool. The blinds are 100/200 with a 25 ante, and you have 2,000 chips in the small blind. The other players have the following stacks:

| Position | Stack Size |
| --- | --- |

| Big Blind | 3,000 |

| UTG | 4,000 |

You can enter these parameters into ICMIZER and click on "Calculate". ICMIZER will then show you the optimal push/fold range for your position. In this case, it is 22+, A2+, K2+, Q2+, J2+, T3+, 95+, 85+, 75+, 65+, 54+. This means that you should push all-in with any pair, any ace, any king, any queen, any jack, any ten with a kicker of three or higher, any nine with a kicker of five or higher, any eight with a kicker of five or higher, any seven with a kicker of five or higher, any six with a kicker of five or higher, and any five-four suited or offsuit.
  
You can also see how much equity you have in this situation. Equity is the expected value of your stack based on the ICM. In this case, your equity is $11.64, which means that you have an 11.64% chance of winning the tournament if you follow the optimal strategy. You can also see how much equity you gain or lose by pushing or folding with different hands. For example, if you push with A5o (ace-five offsuit), you gain $0.32 in equity. If you fold with A5o, you lose $0.17 in equity. If you push with J7o (jack-seven offsuit), you lose $
